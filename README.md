dotfiles
========

Dotfiles is a back-up of the dotfiles on Mac. 
I use Vundle to manage my plugins, as you should, but have added some customization that fit my needs.

Bundles contained within the .vimrc file include:
  YouCompleteMe
  Syntastic

Most of these settings should run on any Unix-like system with python 2.7 installed.
Particular plugins, YouCompleteMe, require Vim version 7.3.584+.
